# Psych 205 Tutorials
Tutorial exercises from UC Berkeley's Psych 205: Data Analysis. This is the intro stats class for psych grad students at UC Berkeley. 

In this repository I will be collecting the tutorials as R Jupyter notebooks and, in some cases, regular .R scripts as well.

In order to view this online you will need to use [this nbviewerlink](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/whryan/psych-205-tutorials/tree/master/).
